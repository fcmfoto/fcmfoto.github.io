   <h3> Artist statement </h3>

   <p> My work blurs the lines between Activism and Fine Arts, providing alternate perspectives into social, political, economic, and environmental issues. In placing the viewer into an immersive environment, the observer becomes the observed which allows for greater empathy. Deconstructing technological advances in order to explore new possibilities to construct a new understanding of the human condition, while offering a dual perspective not sought after by our current polarized society. the works transparent nature demonstrates our existence is miniscule, but our actions or inactions span decades.<br><br>

 <br><br>My work is not intended to be viewed in a traditional museum or gallery setting. it places the viewer into an unconventional environment, intended to cause an increased understanding and empathy, amplifying the significance of the message. It is intended to be experienced and felt, both physically and emotionally. My workâ€™s first priority is to push change toward social and environmental issues, and not that toward commercial intentions. My work is intended to stand by itself, without the need of the creator.<br><br>

My work is for the people who will not be silenced!
